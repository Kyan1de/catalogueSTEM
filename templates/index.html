        <h1>Welcome to the Catalogue!</h1>
        <p>This is a tool for cataloguing and finding materials in the stem spaces. <br>
          Please keep in mind that this is not a perfect tool, as it requires people to maintain it. <br>
          There will be info on each page explaining them, as well as giving some disclaimers. <br>
          <br>
          If you want to add to this tool, talk to (whoever ends up being responsible for this) about getting your hands on the source code. <br>
          I recommend some knowledge of python, html+css, and javascript, but if you find some other way of doing things (or want to redo this entirely), i'm sure that could work in some way. <br>
          <br>
          anyway, <a href="/db/">this is the main database thingy</a></p>
